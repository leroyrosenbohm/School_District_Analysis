# School_District_Analysis
Standardized test scores analysis

##Overview of the school district analysis:

Performing an analysis using school and student data to show school performance trends and influence future budget decisions. 

##Purpose
The purpose of this challenge was to compare results of analysis after removing ninth grade math and reading scores at Thomas High School

##Results:

There was a not a hugely significant change in results when the ninth grade students scores were removed. This could mean that they are withholding lower test scores that would have a more significant impact in an effort to not have their budget decreased.
